# StarWars blog

## Introduction
This is a Star Wars Blog Project using Django Framework with an Agile methodology approach. This project is a web application deployed on Heroku that allows fans to share their insights, theories, and adventures within the Star Wars universe. The blog is built using the powerful Django framework for Python.

The aim of this project is to create a community where Star Wars enthusiasts can document their thoughts, showcase artwork, and connect with like-minded individuals. With a user-friendly design, navigating the website to find relevant information is a breeze. Additionally, the project includes an admin interface that allows the administrator to manage content, users, and other aspects of the website.

## User Experience
The goal of this project is to provide a platform for users where they share their stories with other users and find inspiration.

## Agile Methodology

My Star wars blog project was developed using Agile methodology. Its first time I used agile methology and it was very confusing, I kept on forgetting to do user stories and just kept on working on my project.
It was very interresting experience and I made lots of mess during development of my project. Please find user stories over [here](https://github.com/users/PeterSvk1/projects/4/views/1)
